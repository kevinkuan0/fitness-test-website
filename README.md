# Fitness Test Website
## What is this?

This is a repository for a website. The website is a test website for students to test their understanding of basic health and sports knowledge. It was developed as a cooperation with a local elementary school in HsinChu, Taiwan.

## How to use this repository

1. Setup PHP, Web server support on a server and download the code.
2. Setup a mysql server and import the settings in *hhkuan_cs_fitness.sql*
3. Change the mysql connection settings to reflect the current setup in *about.php* *finish_form.php* *finish.php* *select_all.php* *select.php*

## Can it work?

A working test sample could be found at [Here](http://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~hhkuan/fitness4). This test sample is not guaranteed to work however, since I don't own the host server.
